        "<human>": "What is the relevance of finance in the climate change debate and negotiations?",
        "<bot>": "Climate change has major implications in terms of finance. All actions to address climate change ultimately involve costs. Funding is vital for countries like India to design and implement adaptation and mitigation plans and projects. On the other hand, it is widely acknowledged that the costs of climate change actions are relatively high for developing countries The problem is more severe for developing countries like India, would be among the hardest hit by climate change. Moreover, beyond being vulnerable to climate change impacts, developing countries have fewer resources to adapt: socially, technologically and financially and also have claims of competing demand on the scarce resources available."
    },
    {
        "<human>": "How does the provision of finance to developing countries relate to the articles of the Convention?",
        "<bot>": "In view of 'common but differentiated responsibilities', and varying contributions to climate change by different countries, the articles of the UNFCCC Convention clearly make provisions regarding , who the providers of the resources would be and where the resources are needed. Article 4.3, establishes that the developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in Annex II shall provide new and additional financial resources to meet the agreed full costs incurred by developing country Parties in complying with their obligations under the convention."
    },
    {
        "<human>": "Do the provision of funds under the Convention justify the requirement of climate change finance needed to address global adaptation and mitigation?",
        "<bot>": "Even though, the Convention has squarely put the responsibility for the provision of financial support on the developed countries, the pledges and commitments taken by them to provide financial resources under the head of fast start finance and long term finance, only collectively amounts to US$ 30 billion for the period 2010-12 and US$ 100 billion annually from 2020, respectively. It has been estimated by many studies that the funds currently available under the Kyoto Protocol and the Convention are small compared to the magnitude of need assessed. The UNFCCC has estimated a requirement of US$ 200-210 billion in additional annual investment in 2030 to return GHG emissions to current levels."
    },
    {
        "<human>": "How do the developed country Parties intend to meet their commitment under long term finance? What is the stance of developing countries on this?",
        "<bot>": "The goal of long term finance is to raise US$ 100 billion annually by 2020 to fund climate change adaptation and mitigation in developing countries. The mobilization of this requisite amount has been agreed from a variety of sources- public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources. However many developing countries are of the view that though alternative and private sources can be explored to fill the gaps between the demand and supply of climate finance, public finance should be at the core to ensure predictability and reliability of flow of funds to the developing countries. On the other hand, developed countries seem to be pushing this responsibility on the alternative and private sector due to their current weak fiscal and economic environment."
    },
    {
        "<human>": " What do the terms 'new and additional' mean in the context of climate change finance negotiations?",
        "<bot>": "The term 'new and additional' in the context of provision of finances by developed countries can be traced right from the text of the Convention to various COP decisions like Bali Action Plan, Copenhagen Accord and Cancun Agreements. For example, the Copenhagen Accord notes that, 'The collective commitment by developed countries is to provide new and additional resources, including forestry and investments through international institutions, approaching USD 30 billion for the period 2010-2012 with balanced allocation between adaptation and mitigation.' In this sense 'new and additional' refers to provision of financial resources that represent new commitment, rather than those that are diverted from flows that have already been earmarked for some other form of development assistance. Increasing resources flowing to climate finance should not lead to a reduction of resources available for development assistance."

        "<bot>": "Global environment Facility was created in 1991 as a result of mounting concern in the preceding decade over global environmental problems and efforts to formulate financing responses to address these problems. Of the many ideas for financing environmentally beneficial projects proposed by various governmental and non-governmental institutions, the GEF was the one which finally received the necessary political and financial support. The GEF is funded by donor nations, who commit money every four years through a process known as GEF replenishment. The GEF makes these grants available to developing countries and economies in transition to support actions to address critical threats to the global environment in the areas related to biodiversity, climate change, international waters, land degradation, the ozone layer and persistent organic pollutants. Apart from serving as the financial mechanism of UNFCCC, GEF also serves as the financial mechanism of other Conventions, namely Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Stockholm Convention on POPs and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD)."
    },
    {
        "<human>": "Why was there a need to set up the Green Climate Fund , when already the GEF was set up?",
        "<bot>": "With the growing realization about the large amount of resources that would be required for climate change mitigation and adaptation, especially in developing countries and also with fourth assessment report of the IPCC establishing this fact. It became evident that the funding and operational arrangements under the Global Environment Facility were inadequate, and there was a need for major and urgent reforms in the financial mechanism. With this, the developing countries initiated the talks on the need of a new green fund to carry out the full mandate of provision of financial resources to developing countries exclusively dedicated to climate change, unlike GEF which serves broader areas of global environment. Moreover, the GEF is based on voluntary contributions rather than being based on the principle of assessed contributions, which generates concerns over the political neutrality of the Fund. It was established at that time without any legal capacity and there were also other concerns, like lack of financing for adaptation. This is also because adaptation targets local impacts and associated vulnerabilities rather than generating global benefits, which the GEF mandates."

        "<bot>": "The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is designated as an operating entity of the Financial Mechanism of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which is accountable to and will function under the guidance of the Conference of the Parties (COP). It has been formed in accordance with article 11 of the Convention, and has been founded within the framework of the UNFCCC as a mechanism to transfer money from the developed to the developing world, in order to assist the developing countries in adaptation and mitigation actions to combat climate change. The formal decision to form this Fund was taken at the 15th CoP in Copenhagen. And it is expected that the GCF would deliver a significant portion of the climate finance pledge by developed countries to mobilize $100 billion per year by 2020 for mitigation and adaptation in developing countries."

India played a key role in pushing for a satisfactory consensus outcome on the above features and was able to secure them through challenging rounds of negotiations.

However, a lot more needs to be done for ensuring enhanced operationalization of the GCF.
